# Kubernetes Deployment Strategies

In Kubernetes (K8s), different deployment strategies allow for managing how new versions of applications are rolled out. These strategies ensure minimal disruption to your application and help control updates efficiently. Below is a summary of common deployment strategies in Kubernetes:

## 1. Recreate Deployment
- **How it works**: The recreate strategy shuts down all the existing pods and creates new ones. During this process, the service becomes unavailable.
- **Use case**: Suitable when downtime is acceptable, or the new version is incompatible with the old one.
- **Pros**: Simple and straightforward; ensures that all new pods run the updated version.
- **Cons**: Causes downtime since all old pods are stopped before new ones are created.

## 2. Rolling Update (Default)
- **How it works**: In a rolling update, new pods are gradually created to replace the old pods, ensuring that a certain number of pods are always running. Parameters like `maxUnavailable` and `maxSurge` can be used to control the number of pods that can be unavailable or in excess during the rollout.
  
  - **maxUnavailable**: Specifies the maximum number of pods that can be unavailable during the update.
  - **maxSurge**: Specifies the maximum number of new pods that can be created beyond the desired number of pods.

- **Use case**: Ideal when you want to perform an upgrade without any downtime. It's best for environments where continuous service is critical.
- **Pros**: 
  - **Zero downtime**: Service remains available during the upgrade.
  - **Gradual rollout**: Rolling out updates in phases minimizes the impact of failed updates.
  - **Rollback friendly**: If the new version fails, Kubernetes can automatically roll back to the previous version.
- **Cons**: 
  - If there are issues with the new version, it may take time to identify them since pods are updated incrementally.
  - More complex compared to simple recreate deployment, as it involves managing multiple pod versions simultaneously.

## 3. Blue-Green Deployment
- **How it works**: Blue-green deployment creates a new (blue) environment in parallel to the existing (green) environment. Once the blue version is fully deployed and tested, the traffic is switched from the green environment to the blue environment. The old version (green) is kept intact until the new version (blue) is confirmed to be stable.

- **Use case**: Suitable for environments where downtime is not acceptable, and you need a fast rollback option. It allows quick switching between old and new versions with minimal risk.
  
- **Pros**:
  - **Zero downtime**: Since the new version is tested before traffic is switched, users experience no downtime.
  - **Instant rollback**: If issues are discovered with the new version, rolling back is as simple as redirecting traffic to the old environment (green).
  - **Environment isolation**: New and old versions run in completely separate environments, avoiding conflicts or issues during the update.
  
- **Cons**:
  - **Resource-heavy**: Requires double the resources (compute, storage, etc.) during deployment since both versions run in parallel.
  - **Traffic switch complexity**: Proper orchestration is required to ensure smooth traffic switching.
  - **Data consistency**: Care must be taken to ensure that database or stateful changes are compatible between the blue and green versions.

### Steps for Implementing Blue-Green Deployment in Kubernetes:
1. **Create the blue version**: Deploy the new version alongside the existing green version.
2. **Test the blue version**: Ensure the new version works as expected without redirecting any live traffic.
3. **Switch traffic**: Update the service to point to the blue version instead of the green one.
4. **Monitor**: Keep an eye on the blue version to catch any issues.
5. **Delete the green version** (optional): Once confirmed, you can decommission the old version, freeing up resources.

## 4. Canary Deployment
- **How it works**: The new version of the application is deployed to a small subset of users or nodes. Gradually, as confidence in the new version grows, more traffic is directed to it until it completely replaces the old version.
- **Use case**: Ideal for feature testing or risk mitigation. The gradual rollout allows for early detection of issues.
- **Pros**: Controlled rollout to minimize risk; allows early identification of issues.
- **Cons**: Requires fine-grained traffic management and monitoring.

## 5. A/B Testing
- **How it works**: Similar to canary deployment, but traffic is split between two different versions (A and B) of the application to test which performs better under real-world conditions.
- **Use case**: Useful for testing new features, UI changes, or performance optimizations with real traffic.
- **Pros**: Live testing with actual users; allows comparative performance analysis.
- **Cons**: Requires sophisticated traffic routing and monitoring mechanisms.

## 6. Shadow Deployment
- **How it works**: The new version of the application receives a copy of the live traffic alongside the old version, but the responses from the new version are not sent back to the users. This is useful for testing how the new version handles live traffic without affecting the user experience.
- **Use case**: Ideal for testing under production conditions without impacting live users.
- **Pros**: Test with live traffic without user impact.
- **Cons**: Requires duplication of traffic and additional resource allocation.

## 7. Ramped Deployment
- **How it works**: Similar to rolling updates, ramped deployment gradually shifts traffic from the old version to the new version over time.
- **Use case**: Useful for slow migrations where you want to ensure stability before moving all traffic to the new version.
- **Pros**: Smooth transition of traffic over time, reducing risk.
- **Cons**: Can be slow, and misconfigurations can delay the complete rollout.
