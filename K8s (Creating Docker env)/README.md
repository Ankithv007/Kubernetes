# this is for minikube
### The command eval $(minikube docker-env) is used to set your terminal environment to work with the Docker daemon inside your Minikube VM

```
eval $(minikube docker-env)
```
### What Does the Command Do?
 - Minikube Context: Minikube runs a local Kubernetes cluster, and it includes its own Docker daemon. This means that when you run Docker commands, you’re interacting with the Docker daemon that Minikube manages
 - Docker Environment Variables: When you run minikube docker-env, it generates the necessary environment variables that point your Docker commands to the Docker daemon inside Minikube instead of your local Docker installation.
 - Using eval:
 - The eval command takes the output of the command inside the parentheses and executes it in the current shell.
 - So, when you run eval $(minikube docker-env), it sets environment variables like DOCKER_HOST, DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY, and DOCKER_CERT_PATH in your current terminal session.

  ### Why Is This Necessary? 
  - Building Images: By running this command, you can build Docker images directly within the Minikube environment. This way, any images you create will be accessible to your Kubernetes cluster without needing to push them to Docker Hub or another registry.
  - Consistency: It ensures that the Docker commands you run (like docker build or docker run) will use Minikube's Docker daemon, which is important for local development and testing.
### to verify 
```
docker images
```

### Summary
- The command sets your terminal to use Minikube's Docker daemon.
- It allows you to build Docker images locally that can be directly used in your Minikube Kubernetes cluster.
= It’s a crucial step for local development with Kubernetes using Minikube.
